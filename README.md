# Puaka
Puaka is a centrifugal projectile launcher for peening various metals.

## Description
Puaka is a projectile launcher system that uses one motor-driven wheel at a High rpm to launch 12mm steel ball bearings. In addition to this direct drive wheel, there is an additional non-powered wheel that applies friction to projectiles inside a PVC hopper for launching.

This system was tested by firing 10 of the aforementioned projectiles at a set distance of 1 meter. These projectiles are fed into the two wheels using a PVC hopper system. The ball rolls into a space between the direct drive wheel and the unpowered wheel and then is propelled at a high speed between the two wheels.

The RPM of the motor was approximated using high-speed slow-mo video and a marker on the wheel for tracking rotations in relation to FPS. This RPM allowed for a potential KE to be calculated for comparison with actual chronograph readings.

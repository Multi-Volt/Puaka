# Puaka
Puaka is a centrifugal projectile launcher for peening various metals.

## Description
Testing was conducted at a distance of 1 meter. To determine the RPM of the main motor driving the system SlowMo video was taken at 1/8 of the original video speed. This allowed for an approximation of RPM due to how many frames it took for one complete wheel rotation.
